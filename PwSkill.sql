Constraints are rules applied to columns in a database table to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. They play a crucial role in maintaining data integrity by preventing invalid data from being entered into the database. Here are some common types of constraints and their purposes, along with examples:

1. Primary Key Constraint
Purpose: Ensures that each row in a table has a unique identifier and prevents duplicate records. Example: The emp_id column in the employees table can be defined as the primary key.

sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
2. Foreign Key Constraint
Purpose: Enforces a link between the data in two tables and ensures referential integrity. Example: The department_id in the employees table can reference the department_id in the departments table.

sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
3. Unique Constraint
Purpose: Ensures that all values in a column are unique across the table. Example: The email column in the employees table should be unique for each employee.

sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    age INT
);
4. Not Null Constraint
Purpose: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values. Example: The emp_name column in the employees table should not be NULL.

sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT
);
5. Check Constraint
Purpose: Ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specific condition. Example: The age column in the employees table should have a minimum value of 18.

sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
);
6. Default Constraint
Purpose: Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified during an insert operation. Example: The salary column in the employees table should have a default value of 30,000.

sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL DEFAULT 30000
);
Benefits of Constraints:
Data Integrity: Constraints prevent invalid data from being entered, ensuring the consistency and accuracy of the data.

Reliability: By enforcing rules, constraints ensure that the database behaves predictably.

Relationship Management: Foreign keys maintain the relationships between tables, preserving referential integrity.

Uniqueness: Unique constraints prevent duplicate values, ensuring the uniqueness of data.

Mandatory Fields: Not Null constraints ensure that essential fields always have a value. */

/*3. 
NOT NULL Constraint:
Purpose: The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to ensure that every row must have a value in that column. This constraint enforces the integrity of the data by preventing the storage of NULL values in the specified column.

Use Cases:

Mandatory Fields: Certain fields are critical for the operation of the database, such as an employeeâ€™s name or a transaction date. By applying the NOT NULL constraint, you ensure that these critical fields always have a value.

Data Consistency: It helps maintain data consistency by ensuring that there are no gaps or missing values in essential columns.

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    salary DECIMAL
);
Primary Key and NULL Values:
Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?: No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values. The primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. By definition, it must contain unique and non-null values for each record.
Justification:

Uniqueness: A primary key enforces uniqueness for each record, and a NULL value does not contribute to this uniqueness. If NULL values were allowed, it would be impossible to uniquely identify records that contain NULL.

Referential Integrity: The primary key is often referenced by foreign keys in other tables. Allowing NULL values in a primary key would break referential integrity, as foreign keys would not be able to consistently reference a unique, non-null value.
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    salary DECIMAL
);
*/

/* 4.

Adding a Constraint
To add a constraint, you can use the ALTER TABLE command followed by the specific type of constraint you want to add. Here's an example of adding a PRIMARY KEY constraint:

Example: Adding a Primary Key Constraint

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_employee_id PRIMARY KEY (employee_id);

Example: Adding a Foreign Key Constraint

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id);

Example: Adding a Unique Constraint

ALTER TABLE users
ADD CONSTRAINT uc_username UNIQUE (username);

Removing a Constraint
To remove a constraint, you can also use the ALTER TABLE command, but this time with the DROP CONSTRAINT clause.

Example: Removing a Primary Key Constraint

ALTER TABLE employees
DROP CONSTRAINT pk_employee_id;

Example: Removing a Foreign Key Constraint

ALTER TABLE orders
DROP CONSTRAINT fk_customer_id;

Example: Removing a Unique Constraint

ALTER TABLE users
DROP CONSTRAINT uc_username;

/* 5.

Primary Key Constraint Violation
Attempting to insert a duplicate value in a primary key column will violate the primary key constraint. Consequence: The insertion will fail. Example Error Message:

ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pk_employee_id"
DETAIL: Key (employee_id)=(123) already exists.

Foreign Key Constraint Violation
Attempting to insert or update a value in a foreign key column that does not exist in the referenced primary key column will violate the foreign key constraint. Consequence: The insertion or update will fail. 

Example Error Message:
ERROR: insert or update on table "orders" violates foreign key constraint "fk_customer_id"
DETAIL: Key (customer_id)=(456) is not present in table "customers".

Unique Constraint Violation
Attempting to insert a duplicate value in a unique column will violate the unique constraint. Consequence: The insertion will fail.

Example Error Message:
ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "uc_username"
DETAIL: Key (username)=(john_doe) already exists.

Check Constraint Violation
Attempting to insert or update a value that does not satisfy the check constraint will violate the check constraint.

Example Error Message:
ERROR: new row for relation "employees" violates check constraint "chk_age"
DETAIL: Failing row contains (123, John, Doe, -5).

Not Null Constraint Violation
Attempting to insert or update a column with a NULL value in a column that is defined with a NOT NULL constraint will violate the constraint. Consequence: The insertion or update will fail.

Example Error Message:
ERROR: null value in column "employee_name" violates not-null constraint
DETAIL: Failing row contains (124, null, 30).

eferential Integrity Violation
Deleting a record that is being referenced by a foreign key in another table will violate the referential integrity constraint. Consequence: The deletion will fail

Example Error Message:
ERROR: update or delete on table "customers" violates foreign key constraint "fk_customer_id" on table "orders"
DETAIL: Key (customer_id)=(123) is still referenced from table "orders".

Primary Keys
Primary keys are unique identifiers for records in a table. They ensure that each record is distinct and can be reliably referenced. In the Maven Movies database, primary keys are typically found in tables like:

Customer: Customer_ID

Film: Film_ID

Inventory: Inventory_ID

Rental: Rental_ID

Foreign Keys
Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables. They reference primary keys in other tables, ensuring referential integrity. In the Maven Movies database, foreign keys are typically found in tables like:

Rental: Customer_ID (references Customer.Customer_ID)

Inventory: Film_ID (references Film.Film_ID)

Inventory: Store_ID (references Store.Store_ID)

Differences
Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record within its own table.

Foreign Key: Links one table to another, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

Determining 2NF Compliance

To determine if the rental table is in 2NF, we need to check if it meets the following conditions:

1. The table is in 1NF (already checked).
2. All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.

In this case, the primary key is rental_id, which is a single column. However, we can still check if there are any partial dependencies.

Identifying Partial Dependencies

Upon examining the table structure, we notice that rental_date, return_date, customer_id, and staff_id depend on the rental_id. However, inventory_id also depends on the rental_id, but it's not a partial dependency in this case.

Normalization Steps (Not Required)

Since we didn't find any partial dependencies, the rental table is already in 2NF. Therefore, no normalization steps are required.

However, if we had found partial dependencies, we would need to create separate tables to eliminate them and achieve 2NF. The general steps would involve:

1. Identify the partial dependencies.
2. Create a new table with the dependent attributes and the relevant part of the primary key.
3. Remove the dependent attributes from the original table.

Transitive Dependencies

Upon examining the table structure, I've identified the following transitive dependencies:

2. customer_id â†’ email (A customer has an email address.)
*Note: The email column is not present in the payment table, but it's present in the customer table, which is referenced by the customer_id foreign key.

However, the payment table also contains the amount and payment_date columns, which depend on the payment_id. But, the customer_id and staff_id columns also depend on the payment_id, creating a transitive dependency:

payment_id â†’ customer_id â†’ email

Normalization Steps

To normalize the payment table to 3NF, we'll eliminate the transitive dependencies by removing the customer_id and staff_id columns, which are already referenced by the rental_id foreign key. We'll also create a new table to store the payment details.
